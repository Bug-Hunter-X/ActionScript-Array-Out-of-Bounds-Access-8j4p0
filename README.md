This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in ActionScript 3 related to accessing array elements outside of their valid index range.  The `bug.as` file contains code that attempts to assign a value to an array element at an index exceeding its bounds.  This operation, while not throwing an error, results in unpredictable behavior. The `bugSolution.as` file offers a solution demonstrating how to effectively handle this scenario.
